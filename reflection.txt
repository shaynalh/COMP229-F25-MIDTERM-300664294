For the midterm assignment, I validated each endpoint using Thunder Client. I added two games released between 
2010-2019 corresponding to my student ID, Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and Barbie Dreamhouse Party. I validated the
GET endpoints ensuring they returned the correct data and status codes. For POST, I added a new game ('Just Dance'), 
and verified that it was added to the list. I validated the PUT endpoint by updating the platform information from 
Playstation to PC and checking for proper 200 response. I validated DELETE by removing the first game, 'Legend of 
Zelda: Breath of the Wild' and checking for proper 201 response. Each endpoint was tested for success and validity 
as evidenced by the screenshots.
